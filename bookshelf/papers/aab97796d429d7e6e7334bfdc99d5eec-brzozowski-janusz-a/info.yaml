abstract: 'We survey recent results concerning the complexity of regular languages
  represented by their minimal deterministic finite automata. In addition to the quotient
  complexity of the language -- which is the number of its (left) quotients, and is
  the same as its state complexity -- we also consider the size of its syntactic semigroup
  and the quotient complexity of its atoms -- basic components of every regular language.
  We then turn to the study of the quotient/state complexity of common operations
  on regular languages: reversal, (Kleene) star, product (concatenation) and boolean
  operations. We examine relations among these complexity measures. We discuss several
  subclasses of regular languages defined by convexity. In many, but not all, cases
  there exist "most complex" languages, languages satisfying all these complexity
  measures.'
