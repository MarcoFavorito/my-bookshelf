abstract: We consider here Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas interpreted over \emph{finite}
  traces. We denote this logic by LTLf. The existing approach for LTLf satisfiability
  checking is based on a reduction to standard LTL satisfiability checking. We describe
  here a novel direct approach to LTLf satisfiability checking, where we take advantage
  of the difference in the semantics between LTL and LTLf. While LTL satisfiability
  checking requires finding a \emph{fair cycle} in an appropriate transition system,
  here we need to search only for a finite trace. This enables us to introduce specialized
  heuristics, where we also exploit recent progress in Boolean SAT solving. We have
  implemented our approach in a prototype tool and experiments show that our approach
  outperforms existing approaches.
