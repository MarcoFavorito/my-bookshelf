abstract: 'A common vision from science fiction is that robots will one day inhabit
  our physical spaces, sense the world as we do, assist our physical labours, and
  communicate with us through natural language. Here we study how to design artificial
  agents that can interact naturally with humans using the simplification of a virtual
  environment. This setting nevertheless integrates a number of the central challenges
  of artificial intelligence (AI) research: complex visual perception and goal-directed
  physical control, grounded language comprehension and production, and multi-agent
  social interaction. To build agents that can robustly interact with humans, we would
  ideally train them while they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical.
  Therefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and
  use ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between
  human-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our agents
  poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests, including
  evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly with them.
  These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training and auxiliary
  losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by supervised learning of
  actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent capabilities generalise beyond
  literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we train evaluation models whose ratings
  of agents agree well with human judgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new
  agent models without additional effort. Taken together, our results in this virtual
  environment provide evidence that large-scale human behavioural imitation is a promising
  tool to create intelligent, interactive agents, and the challenge of reliably evaluating
  such agents is possible to surmount.'
