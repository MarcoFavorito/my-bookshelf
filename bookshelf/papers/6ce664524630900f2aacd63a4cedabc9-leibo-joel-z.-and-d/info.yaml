abstract: 'Psychlab is a simulated psychology laboratory inside the first-person 3D
  game world of DeepMind Lab (Beattie et al. 2016). Psychlab enables implementations
  of classical laboratory psychological experiments so that they work with both human
  and artificial agents. Psychlab has a simple and flexible API that enables users
  to easily create their own tasks. As examples, we are releasing Psychlab implementations
  of several classical experimental paradigms including visual search, change detection,
  random dot motion discrimination, and multiple object tracking. We also contribute
  a study of the visual psychophysics of a specific state-of-the-art deep reinforcement
  learning agent: UNREAL (Jaderberg et al. 2016). This study leads to the surprising
  conclusion that UNREAL learns more quickly about larger target stimuli than it does
  about smaller stimuli. In turn, this insight motivates a specific improvement in
  the form of a simple model of foveal vision that turns out to significantly boost
  UNREAL''s performance, both on Psychlab tasks, and on standard DeepMind Lab tasks.
  By open-sourcing Psychlab we hope to facilitate a range of future such studies that
  simultaneously advance deep reinforcement learning and improve its links with cognitive
  science.'
