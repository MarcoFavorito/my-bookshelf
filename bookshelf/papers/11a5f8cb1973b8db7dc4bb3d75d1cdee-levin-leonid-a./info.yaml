abstract: The existence of one-way functions is arguably the most important problem
  in computer theory. The article discusses and refines a number of concepts relevant
  to this problem. For instance, it gives the first combinatorial complete owf, i.e.,
  a function which is one-way if any function is. There are surprisingly many subtleties
  in basic definitions. Some of these subtleties are discussed or hinted at in the
  literature and some are overlooked. Here, a unified approach is attempted.
