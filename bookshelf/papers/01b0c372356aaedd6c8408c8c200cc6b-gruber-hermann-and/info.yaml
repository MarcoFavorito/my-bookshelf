abstract: The equivalence of finite automata and regular expressions dates back to
  the seminal paper of Kleene on events in nerve nets and finite automata from 1956.
  In the present paper we tour a fragment of the literature and summarize results
  on upper and lower bounds on the conversion of finite automata to regular expressions
  and vice versa. We also briefly recall the known bounds for the removal of spontaneous
  transitions (epsilon-transitions) on non-epsilon-free nondeterministic devices.
  Moreover, we report on recent results on the average case descriptional complexity
  bounds for the conversion of regular expressions to finite automata and brand new
  developments on the state elimination algorithm that converts finite automata to
  regular expressions.
