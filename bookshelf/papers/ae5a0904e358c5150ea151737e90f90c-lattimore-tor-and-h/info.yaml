abstract: A possibly immortal agent tries to maximise its summed discounted rewards
  over time, where discounting is used to avoid infinite utilities and encourage the
  agent to value current rewards more than future ones. Some commonly used discount
  functions lead to time-inconsistent behavior where the agent changes its plan over
  time. These inconsistencies can lead to very poor behavior. We generalise the usual
  discounted utility model to one where the discount function changes with the age
  of the agent. We then give a simple characterisation of time-(in)consistent discount
  functions and show the existence of a rational policy for an agent that knows its
  discount function is time-inconsistent.
