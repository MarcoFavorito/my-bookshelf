abstract: This paper describes mathlib, a community-driven effort to build a unified
  library of mathematics formalized in the Lean proof assistant. Among proof assistant
  libraries, it is distinguished by its dependently typed foundations, focus on classical
  mathematics, extensive hierarchy of structures, use of large- and small-scale automation,
  and distributed organization. We explain the architecture and design decisions of
  the library and the social organization that has led us here.
