abstract: Memory is an important aspect of intelligence and plays a role in many deep
  reinforcement learning models. However, little progress has been made in understanding
  when specific memory systems help more than others and how well they generalize.
  The field also has yet to see a prevalent consistent and rigorous approach for evaluating
  agent performance on holdout data. In this paper, we aim to develop a comprehensive
  methodology to test different kinds of memory in an agent and assess how well the
  agent can apply what it learns in training to a holdout set that differs from the
  training set along dimensions that we suggest are relevant for evaluating memory-specific
  generalization. To that end, we first construct a diverse set of memory tasks that
  allow us to evaluate test-time generalization across multiple dimensions. Second,
  we develop and perform multiple ablations on an agent architecture that combines
  multiple memory systems, observe its baseline models, and investigate its performance
  against the task suite.
