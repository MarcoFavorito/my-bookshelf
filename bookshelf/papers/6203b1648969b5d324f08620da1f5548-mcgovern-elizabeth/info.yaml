abstract: The ability to create and to use abstractions in complex environments, that
  is, to systematically ignore irrelevant details, is a key reason that humans are
  effective problem solvers. Although the utility of abstraction is commonly accepted,
  there has been relatively little research on autonomously discovering or creating
  useful abstractions. A system that can create new abstractions autonomously can
  learn and plan in situations that its original designer was not able to anticipate.
  This dissertation introduces two related methods that allow an agent to autonomously
  discover and create temporal abstractions from its accumulated experience with its
  environment. A  temporal abstraction  is an encapsulation of a complex set of actions
  into a single higher-level action that allows an agent to learn and plan while ignoring
  details that appear at finer levels of temporal resolution. The main idea of both
  methods is to search for patterns that occur frequently within an agent's accumulated
  successful experience and that do not occur in unsuccessful experiences. These patterns
  are used to create the new temporal abstractions. The two types of temporal abstractions
  that our methods create are (1)&nbsp;subgoals and closed-loop policies for achieving
  them, and (2)&nbsp;open-loop policies, or action sequences, that are useful “macros.”
  We demonstrate the utility of both types of temporal abstractions in several simulated
  tasks, including two simulated mobile robot tasks. We use these tasks to demonstrate
  that the autonomously created temporal abstractions can both facilitate the learning
  of an agent within a task and can enable effective knowledge transfer to related
  tasks. As a larger task, we focus on the difficult problem of scheduling the assembly
  instructions for computers with multiple pipelines in such a manner that the reordered
  instructions will execute as quickly as possible. We demonstrate that the autonomously
  discovered action sequences can significantly improve performance of the scheduler
  and can enable effective knowledge transfer across similar processors. Both methods
  can extract the temporal abstractions from collections of behavioral trajectories
  generated by different processes. In particular, we demonstrate that the methods
  can be effective when applied to collections generated by reinforcement learning
  agents, heuristic searchers, and human tele-operators.
