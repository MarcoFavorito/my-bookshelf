abstract: Markov decision problems (MDPs) provide the foundations for a number of
  problems of interest to AI researchers studying automated planning and reinforcement
  learning. In this paper, we summarize results regarding the complexity of solving
  MDPs and the running time of MDP solution algorithms. We argue that, although MDPs
  can be solved efficiently in theory, more study is needed to reveal practical algorithms
  for solving large problems quickly. To encourage future research, we sketch some
  alternative methods of analysis that rely on the structure of MDPs.
