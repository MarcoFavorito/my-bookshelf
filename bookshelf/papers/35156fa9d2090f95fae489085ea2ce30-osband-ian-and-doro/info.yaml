abstract: This paper introduces the Behaviour Suite for Reinforcement Learning, or
  bsuite for short. bsuite is a collection of carefully-designed experiments that
  investigate core capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL) agents with two objectives.
  First, to collect clear, informative and scalable problems that capture key issues
  in the design of general and efficient learning algorithms. Second, to study agent
  behaviour through their performance on these shared benchmarks. To complement this
  effort, we open source github.com/deepmind/bsuite, which automates evaluation and
  analysis of any agent on bsuite. This library facilitates reproducible and accessible
  research on the core issues in RL, and ultimately the design of superior learning
  algorithms. Our code is Python, and easy to use within existing projects. We include
  examples with OpenAI Baselines, Dopamine as well as new reference implementations.
  Going forward, we hope to incorporate more excellent experiments from the research
  community, and commit to a periodic review of bsuite from a committee of prominent
  researchers.
