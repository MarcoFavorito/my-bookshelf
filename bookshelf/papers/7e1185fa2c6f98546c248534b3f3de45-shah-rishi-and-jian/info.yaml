abstract: Coverage path planning is a well-studied problem in robotics in which a
  robot must plan a path that passes through every point in a given area repeatedly,
  usually with a uniform frequency. To address the scenario in which some points need
  to be visited more frequently than others, this problem has been extended to non-uniform
  coverage planning. This paper considers the variant of non-uniform coverage in which
  the robot does not know the distribution of relevant events beforehand and must
  nevertheless learn to maximize the rate of detecting events of interest. This continual
  area sweeping problem has been previously formalized in a way that makes strong
  assumptions about the environment, and to date only a greedy approach has been proposed.
  We generalize the continual area sweeping formulation to include fewer environmental
  constraints, and propose a novel approach based on reinforcement learning in a Semi-Markov
  Decision Process. This approach is evaluated in an abstract simulation and in a
  high fidelity Gazebo simulation. These evaluations show significant improvement
  upon the existing approach in general settings, which is especially relevant in
  the growing area of service robotics.
