abstract: Bridging the 'reality gap' that separates simulated robotics from experiments
  on hardware could accelerate robotic research through improved data availability.
  This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models
  on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the
  simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to
  the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization,
  which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it
  is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to $1.5$cm and
  robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with
  non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors,
  we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our
  knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained
  only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world
  for the purpose of robotic control.
