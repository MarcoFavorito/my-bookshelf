abstract: The purpose of this technical report is two-fold. First of all, it introduces
  a suite of challenging continuous control tasks (integrated with OpenAI Gym) based
  on currently existing robotics hardware. The tasks include pushing, sliding and
  pick & place with a Fetch robotic arm as well as in-hand object manipulation with
  a Shadow Dexterous Hand. All tasks have sparse binary rewards and follow a Multi-Goal
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework in which an agent is told what to do using
  an additional input.   The second part of the paper presents a set of concrete research
  ideas for improving RL algorithms, most of which are related to Multi-Goal RL and
  Hindsight Experience Replay.
