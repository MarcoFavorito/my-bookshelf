abstract: 'Recent approaches in robotics follow the insight that perception is facilitated
  by interaction with the environment. These approaches are subsumed under the term
  of Interactive Perception (IP). It provides the following benefits: (i) interaction
  with the environment creates a rich sensory signal that would otherwise not be present
  and (ii) knowledge of the regularity in the combined space of sensory data and action
  parameters facilitate the prediction and interpretation of the signal. In this survey
  we postulate this as a principle and collect evidence in support by analyzing and
  categorizing existing work in this area. We also provide an overview of the most
  important applications of Interactive Perception. We close this survey by discussing
  remaining open questions. Thereby, we hope to define a field and inspire future
  work.'
