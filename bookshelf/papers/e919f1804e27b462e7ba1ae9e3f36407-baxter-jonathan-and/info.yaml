abstract: In this paper we present TDLeaf(lambda), a variation on the TD(lambda) algorithm
  that enables it to be used in conjunction with minimax search. We present some experiments
  in both chess and backgammon which demonstrate its utility and provide comparisons
  with TD(lambda) and another less radical variant, TD-directed(lambda). In particular,
  our chess program, ``KnightCap,'' used TDLeaf(lambda) to learn its evaluation function
  while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS, fics.onenet.net). It improved
  from a 1650 rating to a 2100 rating in just 308 games. We discuss some of the reasons
  for this success and the relationship between our results and Tesauro's results
  in backgammon.
