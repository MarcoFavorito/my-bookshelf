abstract: Credit assignment in reinforcement learning is the problem of measuring
  an action influence on future rewards. In particular, this requires separating skill
  from luck, ie. disentangling the effect of an action on rewards from that of external
  factors and subsequent actions. To achieve this, we adapt the notion of counterfactuals
  from causality theory to a model-free RL setup. The key idea is to condition value
  functions on future events, by learning to extract relevant information from a trajectory.
  We then propose to use these as future-conditional baselines and critics in policy
  gradient algorithms and we develop a valid, practical variant with provably lower
  variance, while achieving unbiasedness by constraining the hindsight information
  not to contain information about the agent actions. We demonstrate the efficacy
  and validity of our algorithm on a number of illustrative problems.
