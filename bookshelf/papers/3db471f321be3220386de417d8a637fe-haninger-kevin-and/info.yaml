abstract: 'Learned representations of dynamical systems reduce dimensionality, potentially
  supporting downstream reinforcement learning (RL). However, no established methods
  predict a representation''s suitability for control and evaluation is largely done
  via downstream RL performance, slowing representation design. Towards a principled
  evaluation of representations for control, we consider the relationship between
  the true state and the corresponding representations, proposing that ideally each
  representation corresponds to a unique true state. This motivates two metrics: temporal
  smoothness and high mutual information between true state/representation. These
  metrics are related to established representation objectives, and studied on Lagrangian
  systems where true state, information requirements, and statistical properties of
  the state can be formalized for a broad class of systems. These metrics are shown
  to predict reinforcement learning performance in a simulated peg-in-hole task when
  comparing variants of autoencoder-based representations.'
