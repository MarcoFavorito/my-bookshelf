abstract: In the pursuit of artificial general intelligence, our most significant
  measurement of progress is an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of
  environments. Existing platforms for constructing such environments are typically
  constrained by the technologies they are founded on, and are therefore only able
  to provide a subset of scenarios necessary to evaluate progress. To overcome these
  shortcomings, we present our use of Unity, a widely recognized and comprehensive
  game engine, to create more diverse, complex, virtual simulations. We describe the
  concepts and components developed to simplify the authoring of these environments,
  intended for use predominantly in the field of reinforcement learning. We also introduce
  a practical approach to packaging and re-distributing environments in a way that
  attempts to improve the robustness and reproducibility of experiment results. To
  illustrate the versatility of our use of Unity compared to other solutions, we highlight
  environments already created using our approach from published papers. We hope that
  others can draw inspiration from how we adapted Unity to our needs, and anticipate
  increasingly varied and complex environments to emerge from our approach as familiarity
  grows.
