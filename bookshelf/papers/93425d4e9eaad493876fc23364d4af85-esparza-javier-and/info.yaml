abstract: We present a unified translation of LTL formulas into deterministic Rabin
  automata, limit-deterministic B\"uchi automata, and nondeterministic B\"uchi automata.
  The translations yield automata of asymptotically optimal size (double or single
  exponential, respectively). All three translations are derived from one single Master
  Theorem of purely logical nature. The Master Theorem decomposes the language of
  a formula into a positive boolean combination of languages that can be translated
  into {\omega}-automata by elementary means. In particular, Safra's, ranking, and
  breakpoint constructions used in other translations are not needed.
