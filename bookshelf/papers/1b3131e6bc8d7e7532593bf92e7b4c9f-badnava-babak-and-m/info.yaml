abstract: 'Potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) is a particular category of machine
  learning methods which aims to improve the learning speed of a reinforcement learning
  agent by extracting and utilizing extra knowledge while performing a task. There
  are two steps in the process of transfer learning: extracting knowledge from previously
  learned tasks and transferring that knowledge to use it in a target task. The latter
  step is well discussed in the literature with various methods being proposed for
  it, while the former has been explored less. With this in mind, the type of knowledge
  that is transmitted is very important and can lead to considerable improvement.
  Among the literature of both the transfer learning and the potential-based reward
  shaping, a subject that has never been addressed is the knowledge gathered during
  the learning process itself. In this paper, we presented a novel potential-based
  reward shaping method that attempted to extract knowledge from the learning process.
  The proposed method extracts knowledge from episodes'' cumulative rewards. The proposed
  method has been evaluated in the Arcade learning environment and the results indicate
  an improvement in the learning process in both the single-task and the multi-task
  reinforcement learner agents.'
