abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising and powerful technique
  for automatically acquiring control policies that can process raw sensory inputs,
  such as images, and perform complex behaviors. However, extending deep RL to real-world
  robotic tasks has proven challenging, particularly in safety-critical domains such
  as autonomous flight, where a trial-and-error learning process is often impractical.
  In this paper, we explore the following question: can we train vision-based navigation
  policies entirely in simulation, and then transfer them into the real world to achieve
  real-world flight without a single real training image? We propose a learning method
  that we call CAD$^2$RL, which can be used to perform collision-free indoor flight
  in the real world while being trained entirely on 3D CAD models. Our method uses
  single RGB images from a monocular camera, without needing to explicitly reconstruct
  the 3D geometry of the environment or perform explicit motion planning. Our learned
  collision avoidance policy is represented by a deep convolutional neural network
  that directly processes raw monocular images and outputs velocity commands. This
  policy is trained entirely on simulated images, with a Monte Carlo policy evaluation
  algorithm that directly optimizes the network''s ability to produce collision-free
  flight. By highly randomizing the rendering settings for our simulated training
  set, we show that we can train a policy that generalizes to the real world, without
  requiring the simulator to be particularly realistic or high-fidelity. We evaluate
  our method by flying a real quadrotor through indoor environments, and further evaluate
  the design choices in our simulator through a series of ablation studies on depth
  prediction. For supplementary video see: https://youtu.be/nXBWmzFrj5s'
