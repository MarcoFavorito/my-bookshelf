abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional time series plays a crucial role in many applications
  such as demand forecasting and financial predictions. Modern datasets can have millions
  of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e they are extremely high dimensional
  (one dimension for each individual time-series). There is a need for exploiting
  global patterns and coupling them with local calibration for better prediction.
  However, most recent deep learning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional,
  i.e, even though they are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future
  forecast for a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension.
  In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep forecasting
  model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular, DeepGLO is a hybrid
  model that combines a global matrix factorization model regularized by a temporal
  convolution network, along with another temporal network that can capture local
  properties of each time-series and associated covariates. Our model can be trained
  effectively on high-dimensional but diverse time series, where different time series
  can have vastly different scales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical
  results demonstrate that DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for
  example, we see more than 25% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a public
  dataset that contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.
