abstract: We show that non-Markovian open quantum systems can exhibit exact Markovian
  dynamics up to an arbitrarily long time; the non-Markovianity of such systems is
  thus perfectly "hidden", i.e. not experimentally detectable by looking at the reduced
  dynamics alone. This shows that non-Markovianity is physically undecidable and extremely
  counterintuitive, since its features can change at any time, without precursors.
  Some interesting examples are discussed.
