abstract: While a lot of progress has been made in recent years, the dynamics of learning
  in deep nonlinear neural networks remain to this day largely misunderstood. In this
  work, we study the case of binary classification and prove various properties of
  learning in such networks under strong assumptions such as linear separability of
  the data. Extending existing results from the linear case, we confirm empirical
  observations by proving that the classification error also follows a sigmoidal shape
  in nonlinear architectures. We show that given proper initialization, learning expounds
  parallel independent modes and that certain regions of parameter space might lead
  to failed training. We also demonstrate that input norm and features' frequency
  in the dataset lead to distinct convergence speeds which might shed some light on
  the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks. We provide a comparison
  between the dynamics of learning with cross-entropy and hinge losses, which could
  prove useful to understand recent progress in the training of generative adversarial
  networks. Finally, we identify a phenomenon that we baptize \textit{gradient starvation}
  where the most frequent features in a dataset prevent the learning of other less
  frequent but equally informative features.
