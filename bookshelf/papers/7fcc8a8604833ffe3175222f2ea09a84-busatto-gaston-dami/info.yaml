abstract: In this paper, we consider the online computation of a strategy that aims
  at optimizing the expected average reward in a Markov decision process. The strategy
  is computed with a receding horizon and using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). We
  augment the MCTS algorithm with the notion of symbolic advice, and show that its
  classical theoretical guarantees are maintained. Symbolic advice are used to bias
  the selection and simulation strategies of MCTS. We describe how to use QBF and
  SAT solvers to implement symbolic advice in an efficient way. We illustrate our
  new algorithm using the popular game Pac-Man and show that the performances of our
  algorithm exceed those of plain MCTS as well as the performances of human players.
