abstract: We develop a mathematical and interpretative foundation for the enterprise
  of decision-theoretic statistical causality (DT), which is a straightforward way
  of representing and addressing causal questions. DT reframes causal inference as
  "assisted decision-making", and aims to understand when, and how, I can make use
  of external data, typically observational, to help me solve a decision problem by
  taking advantage of assumed relationships between the data and my problem.   The
  relationships embodied in any representation of a causal problem require deeper
  justification, which is necessarily context-dependent. Here we clarify the considerations
  needed to support applications of the DT methodology. Exchangeability considerations
  are used to structure the required relationships, and a distinction drawn between
  intention to treat and intervention to treat forms the basis for the enabling condition
  of "ignorability". We also show how the DT perspective unifies and sheds light on
  other popular formalisations of statistical causality, including potential responses
  and directed acyclic graphs.
