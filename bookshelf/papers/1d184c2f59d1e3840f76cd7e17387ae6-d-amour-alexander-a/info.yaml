abstract: ML models often exhibit unexpectedly poor behavior when they are deployed
  in real-world domains. We identify underspecification as a key reason for these
  failures. An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with
  equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification
  is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors
  returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their
  training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very
  differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor
  model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified
  issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains.
  We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using
  examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical
  risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results
  show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines
  that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.
