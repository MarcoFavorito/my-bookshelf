abstract: 'Planning and reinforcement learning are two key approaches to sequential
  decision making. Multi-step approximate real-time dynamic programming, a recently
  successful algorithm class of which AlphaZero [Silver et al., 2018] is an example,
  combines both by nesting planning within a learning loop. However, the combination
  of planning and learning introduces a new question: how should we balance time spend
  on planning, learning and acting? The importance of this trade-off has not been
  explicitly studied before. We show that it is actually of key importance, with computational
  results indicating that we should neither plan too long nor too short. Conceptually,
  we identify a new spectrum of planning-learning algorithms which ranges from exhaustive
  search (long planning) to model-free RL (no planning), with optimal performance
  achieved midway.'
